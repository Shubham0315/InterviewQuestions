What all AWS services have you used in your role?
-
- IAM, S3, EC2, Cloudwatch, Lambda, Code pipeline, ALB, VPC, Subnets, SG, NACL, Config, Cloudfront, RDS, ECR, ECS

------------------------------------------------------

Can you explain what kind of automations have you done using lambda or shell scripting?
-
- I have used AWS lambda and shell scripting to automate several operationsal tasks like EBS snapshot cleanup, S3 data archival, log rotation and triggering notifications for failed jobs
- These automations have reduced manual intervention and improved reliability in the environment

- Lambda
  - Old snapshots were consuming a lot of storage cost
  - We created lambda function to list EBS snapshots older than 15 days (describe EC2 and decsribe snapshots) which deleted them automatically and sends summary to mail or slack using SNS topic
 
  - Lambda triggered by cloudwatch alarms for EC2 high CPU or unhealthy ELB targets. It auto restarts EC2 and notifies us via slack
 
- Shell Scripting
  - To compress or archive logs older than 7 days and remove old log files automatically
  - Shell script to have periodic checks of services and send alert if any service is down
  - Shell scripti for automated backups, monitor memory/CPU
  - Check modified files in specific times

------------------------------------------------------

What language runtime are you using for lambda functions?
-
- Python runtime

------------------------------------------------------

How are you automating infrastructure provisioning?
-
- Frequent question
- Using terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Wite terraform scripts for resources like EC2, VPC, SG, EKS, NACL and apply
- Use modules for easier apply

------------------------------------------------------

Whats the difference between Terraform and Cloud formation?
-
- TF can be used for multi cloud resource setup using HCL language. Works well with AWS, GCP, Azure. TF maintains state file locally or remotely using backend. Its generally faster. We can have reusable modules written

- CFT is AWS restricted only. Writtten in JSON or YML. CFT maintains state automatically. Limited to AWS with few third party integrations.

------------------------------------------------------

Explain terraform workflow
-
- Frequent question
- terraform init - terraform plan - terraform validate (optional syntax check) - terraform apply - terraform detsroy

------------------------------------------------------

What is terraform state file? What is best practice to maintain terraform state file?
-
- Frequent question
- To record the info of all terraform resources created
- Maintain it remotely using S3 as remote backend so that config applied will be auto updated in the state file.

------------------------------------------------------

You did a terraform apply and state file is updated. Now if in AWS UI you delete a resource. Next time when we run terraform code, what will happen?
-
- If we delete resource and run terraform plan it compares whats in config files and whats in state file. Also check AWS existing resources
- It will detect resource recoreded in state file no longer exist in AWS
- So it will re created that missing resource to bring infrastructure back in sync with .tf code and state
- Then it will update statefile with new resource ID and metadata

- Alternatively we can use terraform refresh to update state file with actual state in AWS. Deleted resource will be removed from state file

------------------------------------------------------

Can you explain autoscaling? What are the types?
-
