# DevOps Engineer Interview Questions 

Hey All, I've documented the questions asked in multiple interviews I attended in my job search journey 2025. Attending multiple interviews gave me insights about the pattern of questions we can expect for 4-5 years of DevOps professional. You may see multiple frequent questions here. 

You must have exposure to below DevOps concepts and tools 
-
- **Mandatory** :- Kubernetes/EKS, Terraform, Jenkins CI/CD, Docker
- **Cloud platform** :- any like AWS/GCP/Azure
- **Monitoring tool** :- any from  cloudwatch, DataDog, Prometheus + Grafana
- Linux commands and shell scripting
- **Optional** :- GitLab CICD, Docker compose

Notes:-
- 
- Also please note I have not added questions like introduction, project overview and day to day activities
- I have also not added questions like do you have exposure to specific tool, which tools are you using for particular process
