With your learnings in GCP and working experience in AWS, what differences did you realize? What advantages does AWS have over GCP?
-
- AWS has more mature and extensive ecosystem with a wider range of services and integrations with DevOps tools like Code pipeline, code build and cloud formation. GCP offers capabilities through code build, deployment manager and cloud functions but AWS provides deeper enterprise support and more refined IAM and networking options
- In AWS services like EC2, ASG and ELB are very mature and offer fine grained control. GCP compute engine is simpler to setup but network config and IAM policies are slightly more abstracted
- AWS IAM is very detailed and customizable while GCP IAM is more resource hierarchy based
- GCP has simpler and more predictable pricing model which is good for startups and experimental projects. AWS pricing is complex but offers more cost optimization tools
