# Site Reliability Engineering Principles and work domain questions

How do you define Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and how does it differ from traditional operations?
- SRE is about applying software engineering principles into operations and infrastructure problems. Its goal is to make systems more reliable, scalable and efficient by reducing manual work and automating processes
- Traditional operations teams often focus on maintaining systems reactively by fixing issues when arise and perform manual task. SRE on the other side treats operations as a software problem. Using SRE we can build tools, automation proactively to prevent issues, enforce reliability through SLOs, SLIs and create systems that are fault tolerant by design
- In my current role, instead of manually provisioning AWS infra, I automate it with terraform and have reduced setup time by 70%
- Similarly I implemented observability with Datadog and splunk which led us catch and fix recurring issues/outages proactively
