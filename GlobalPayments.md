What kind of linux administration experience do you have?
-
- Management of users, groups and permissions. Monitoring system performances and resources using top.
- Process monitoring using ps, kill. Automating tasks using cron jobs
- Disk usage monitoring using df, du and cleanup
- Network troubleshooting using ping, traceroute, netstatConfigure SSH access, key based authentications.
- Monitoring logs in /var/log/auth.log or /var/log/secure
- Writing bash scripts like backup, log rotation, cleanup for automation.

----------------------------------------------

Can you explain Linux file stucture or directory structure?
-
- Linux uses single rooted filesystem starting at root /. Every file and directory exists under it

- Directories
  - root
  - /bin :- contains essential command binaries used by all users like ls, cat, cp, mv
  - /dev :- contains device files that represent hardware devices
  - /etc :- for config files. /passwd for user accounts, /ssh for ssh server config
  - /home :- contains home directories for non root users
  - /lib :- contains shared libs needed by binaries
  - /opt :- third party or optional software lcoatoon
  - /sbin :- system binaries
  - /tmp :- temporary files created by users of processes
  - /usr :- user programs
  - /var :- contains files expected to grow/change over time like log files, app state
 
----------------------------------------------

In order to troubleshoot any issue, what types of var files do we monitor? If my server has booted, where the logs get recorded?
-
- /var/log :- logs for system, kernel and apps. Check service errors, auth issues, network problems in syslog
- /var/lib :- logs for data for services. Check DB files, package manager, K8S data
- /var/cache :- logs for cached app data. Check for caching issues or clean if disk full
- /var/tmp :- logs for temporary files preserved across reboots. Check for leftover temporary files causing disk space issue

- /var/log/messages :- general system messages, system events
- /var/log/syslog :- system manages and boot logs

----------------------------------------------

If user is unable to login to server, which log file should we check?
-
- /var.log/auth.log :- stores authentication and authorization messages, SSH attempts, sudo attempts
- /var/log/faillog :- tracks failed login attempts per user
- /var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog

----------------------------------------------

How to monitor linux server performance?
-
- CPU monitoring :- top, htop.
- Memory monitoring :- free
- Disk usage :- df and du
- Network monitoring :- ifconfig, netstat
- Process monitoring :- ps, uptime
- Log monitoring :- tail -f $logfile

----------------------------------------------

What is swap memory?
-
- SWAP is a disk space used as virtual memory when system runs out of physical RAM
- It prevents OOM crashes when RAM is full. Allows more processes to run simultaneously tahn RAM can handle. helps systems with low RAM run heavy apps

----------------------------------------------

What is difference between du and df?
-
- df :- disk free shows disk usage of entire filesystem
- du :- disk usage shows space used by directories or files

----------------------------------------------

Difference between IAM role and IAM user. Can we attach IAM role to IAM user?
- 
- Frequent question
- No we cant attach role to user as users are permanant and roles are temporary

----------------------------------------------

What is instance profile in AWS?
-
- Its a container that allows EC2 to assume IAM role. EC2 cannot directly assume IAM roles, they need instance profile as bridge. It is auto created when we attach role to EC2

----------------------------------------------

How many ways we can access EC2 instance in AWS?
-
- SSH using key pair
- Using EC2 instance connect (ssh -i .pem user@IP)
- Using RDP
- Via AWS console
- AWS System manager. Access without public IP or SSH keys

----------------------------------------------
