# âœ… L1 Infospica Technical (11 Questions) 25 Minutes

In past 6 months which tools have you used mostly? How are you deploying applications onto servers?
-
- Jenkins, EKS, DataDog, Splunk, GitLab
- Deployment is done using jenkins pipelines on EKS. In pipelines we're defining stages like checkout, build, push, deploy. We're hosting apps on EC2 servers

-------------------------------

Write deployment manifest to deploy 2 instances of nginx and explain the same
-
- Frequent question
- Use replicas to define 2 instances and write as general manifest

-------------------------------

How to manage security in kubernetes?
-
- To store secrets we can use AWS secret manager or terraform vault and mount secrets in filesystem to be used by pods
- To grant access to only authorized users make use of RBAC where define roles and bind them with service account to be used by pod
- To prevent unauthorized access to our servers we can make use of Security groups and NACL
- Frequent question
- We can also make use of IAM to restrict access

-------------------------------

Write jenkins pipeline stages
-
- Frequent question

-------------------------------

-------------------------------

Write a simple docker compose file for multiple services
-
- Docker compose is a tool used to build multi container docker apps. We can create multiple containers using single command and compose file
- Define services with names and use required images. We can also define ports, networks to be attached to services

How to authenticate to dockerhub from jenkins
-
- Add docker creds in jenkins - Manage jenkins - credentials - system - global credentials
- Use them in jenkins pipeline using "withCredentials" block
- Never hardcode creds in jenkins file

-------------------------------

What is multi stage build in docker?
- 
- Frequent question
- To run app with minimal dependencies. In runtime only necessary artifacts will be carried for image to run
- Single file with multiple stages. We use AS Builder to copy artifacts between stages
- This enables our image to be lightweiht and containers to run efficiently without much load

-------------------------------

What is AWS VPC architecture?
-
- Frequent question
- VPC, public/private subnets, CIDR ranges, SG, NACL, EC2
- Deploying apps on worker nodes which are EC2
- Control plane is EKS
- Setup is done using terraform

-------------------------------

What is the difference between stateful and stateless in VPC?
-
- Frequent question
- Comes with SG and NACL
- SG are stateful and NACL are stateless
- SG is for instance level and NACL is for subnet level protection
- Stateful SG means if we allow inbound, outbound traffic is auto allowed
- Stateless with NACL means we need to explicitly allow outbound traffic for response to go out

-------------------------------

How to deploy app on production without downtime?
-
- Frequent question
- Use blue-green deployment or canary deployment
- For nodes upgrade use rolling update

-------------------------------
